# Supplementary code for the paper "$SL_2$-factorizations for groups of Lie type"

The code related to the groups of untwisted types is contained in the following two files, executed in ``Python 3.12``:
- ``root_system.py`` is an absolutely minimal implementation of the root systems.
- ``normal_types.ipynb`` is a Jupyter notebook providing the verification of the decomposition procedure for exceptional groups.

The code related to the twisted groups and Suzukiâ€”Ree groups is contained in the following two Jupyter notebooks, executed by the ``SageMath 9.8`` kernel running on ``Python 3.9``:
- ``su3.ipynb`` deals with the special unitary group of degree 3.
- ``suzuki.ipynb`` establishes the required formulas for Suzuki group.
